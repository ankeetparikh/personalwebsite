# Ankeet's Personal Website
This repo contains website for my personal website [ankeetparikh.com](https://ankeetparikh.com).

## For local development
I recommend running a local http server for development. First run `python3 -m http.server` in the project folder and then open `http://localhost:8000/` in the browser.
